  abstract = {Supersaturated material systems in isolation often exhibit the spontaneous evolution of quasi-steady states that are highly patterned. The commonly associated free-boundary degeneracies invite a search for theoretical constraints that select for pattern mode and wavenumber. Devices such as microscopic solvability, phase fields, cellular automata and dissipation principles, among others, are considered. The author emphasizes the universal and successful role of a minimax principle in the dissipation rate in specifying the mode selection, the scaling relations and universality within the phenomena of Ostwald ripening, free dendrites and Widmanstatten figures, eutectoid(ic)s, forced velocity cells and dendrites, and the various Liesegang patterns. The role of solitons in the construction of patterns, and the effects of deterministic chaos at high supersaturations in the deconstruction of patterns are examined. In the most general context self-organization including life, is the outcome of a process in which a system with many internal degrees of freedom accommodates stochastically to the simultaneous influence of a heat bath and a strong, sustained source of available energy. The optimal degree of organization, patterning and autonomy is achieved at a fluctuating dissipation minimax balance point between the dual influences. If either the sink or source tends to dominate, the patterning trend is towards chaos.},

The authors present an overview of some typical examples treated by synergetics, e.g. lasers, fluid instabilities, and instabilities in solid state physics. It is shown how the general concepts allow one to find principles for the construction of neural computers for pattern recognition. A number of further phenomena treated by the concepts of synergetics in biology are briefly indicated. They also give an outline of the typical theoretical methods to deal with these phenomena, namely the microscopic or mesoscopic approach which starts from the Langevin or Fokker-Planck equations. The central concepts of stability, order parameters, and the slaving principle are discussed and it is shown how they allow one to reduce the degree of complexity of such systems close to instability points quite considerably. They also discuss a second approach by means of the maximum information entropy principle which provides one with a macroscopic treatment.},

  abstract = {Synergetics is offered as a physical construct for understanding self-organization. It is a mathematical—physical way of studying how collections of subsystems (such as atoms, cells, animals) can produce structures and patterns by self-organization. The construct is applicable to all kinds of matter. The great generality of thermodynamics pertains to thermal equilibrium or, in irreversible thermodynamics, to systems driven only slightly from that equilibrium. When systems are driven very far from equilibrium, however, new things can happen, and the classic concepts of thermodynamics are no longer adequate. Ordered structures can arise out of formerly chaotic states and can be maintained by energy and matter fluxes passing through the system. The laser is used as an example to exhibit the general concepts and principles of these new “instability” states that can possess ever-increasing order. The concept of “slaving” is fundamental in synergetics. Long-lasting quantities may enslave short-lasting quantities. Symmetry-breaking or selection of bistable state alternatives also may be important in nonequilibrium systems. Because of the slaving principle, there can be an enormous resentative of such higher-ordered enslaving principles. At critical instability points, nonequilibrium systems “test” various configurations or collective notions by fluctuations. These configured dynamic “modes” can act as order parameters and enslave all other modes of the system. This structuring of order parameters can occur within an entire hierarchy of instability points. There are two possible outcomes of such phenomena: completely chaotic motion that can decay to a structureless state when power is turned off; or, typical of biological systems, structure that is maintained even when metabolic processes stop. Function can be latent in form. A mathematical schema is provided and applied to a “morphogenetic” example. —{TheEditor}},
