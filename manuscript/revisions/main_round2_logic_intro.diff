-Urban road networks are prototypical examples of complex systems in which large numbers of heterogeneous agents (drivers) interact through shared infrastructure, giving rise to emergent macroscopic traffic states such as congestion patterns and traffic equilibria. These states arise from decentralized route choice decisions rather than centralized control, making them characteristic cases of self-organization in complex systems \citep{helbing2001traffic, nagel1992cellular, kerner2004physics, chowdhury2000statistical, helbing2009pedestrian}.
+Urban traffic patterns emerge from many local route choices made on shared road infrastructure rather than from centralized coordination.

-For the analytical derivations below, we restrict each OD tuple $w$ to one of two forms: $w = (o, d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n)$, where one origin node $o$ supplies multiple destinations, or $w = (d, o_1, o_2, \dots, o_n)$, where multiple origins supply one destination node $d$. Excluding mixtures of multiple origins and multiple destinations within the same OD tuple is a modeling choice that preserves a unique net flow direction and simplifies the decomposition.
+For the analytical derivations below, each OD tuple is taken in the form $w=(o,d_1,d_2,\dots,d_n)$, i.e., one origin node $o$ supplying multiple destinations. This single-origin convention matches the computational setup and provides one gauge condition ($\lambda_o^w=0$) per subgraph. The opposite convention (multiple origins, one destination) can be treated analogously by reversing edge directions.

-We can circumvent this limitation by decomposing the original graph into a set of \emph{flow subgraphs}. Consider an origin–destination tuple $w=(o,d_1,d_2,\dots,d_{|V|})$. Since there is a single origin node and all remaining nodes act as destinations, the set of edges used by travellers associated with $w$ cannot form directed cycles. Each such subgraph is therefore a DAG by construction.
+We can circumvent this limitation by decomposing the original graph into a set of \emph{flow subgraphs}. Consider an origin–destination tuple $w=(o,d_1,d_2,\dots,d_{|V|})$ and define the corresponding active-edge set by $E^w=\{e\in E: f_e^w>0\}$. Under \cref{eq:lambda-condition} with strictly positive $\beta_e$, the active-support subgraph $G^w(V,E^w)$ is acyclic.
